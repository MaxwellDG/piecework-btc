This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

.env and .env.local files must be populated. Their contents can be found in the .env.dist and .env.local.dist files respectively.

Once an .env file has been populated correctly with MongoDB related information, run the command 'node/scripts/seed.js' from the root directory. This will seed the database with the necessary data for development.

Once an .env.local file has been populated correctly, run the command 'yarn' (you must have yarn installed on your local) to install all dependencies.

Then you may run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
